Tasks: Finish FeedsSigma app
Features:
+ Run in background (minimize to system tray) (found solution)
+ Display feeds content as readable html format (i.e. parsed html string) (found solution)
+ Feed download and notification automation
- Use of WebClient; NotifyIcon change icon, ...
+ Fetch rss feed:
- from CNN.com: xlmn (xml namespace, xml version 1.0, deal with CDATA)
- from StackOverflow.com (custom xml structure; deal with decode html entities to normal string then parse to browser document)
- from Mangapark.net (xml version 2.0; more friendly than 1.0; really simple)
--> See if the text node content is a CDATA node? parse straight CDATA content to string
: find and replace all html entities to its original characters -> form a string.
